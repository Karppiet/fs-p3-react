## Project Reflection

I have made an Code snippet API frontend using REACT.
It automatically fetches all the snippets from the database when started. 
You can post new code snippets using the form.
It has been a bit challenging project, timeframe was too strict and it was the last school project of this autumn. 
I don't have most of the functionality that I wanted and what was needed in the project to make it complete. 
But anyway I learnt the basics of React with it, the challenging part was integrating the Api Snippet API to the back end.
